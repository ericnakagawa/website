<p class="lead">Clear registry username and email.</p>

##### `yarn logout` [](#toc-yarn-logout){#toc-yarn-logout.toc}

This will remove your stored username and email for the [npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/) as setup by [`yarn login`]({{url_base}}/docs/cli/login). You do need to run this to de-authenticate, registry actions are individually authenticated.
